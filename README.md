Main directory for project

Look into backend/frontend for respective info

Frontend: React
Backend: Express + MongoDB

Run the app locally (you have private access to repo):

1. Clone the repository onto your local computer
    - copy the web url from GitHub (the green code dropdown button)
    - run the command `git clone <copied url>`
    - run `git pull` to get most updated version

2. Run the frontend of the app
    - run the command `cd frontend`
    - run the command `npm start`
    - There should be a message that says "Compiled successfully!"
    - Follow the link "http://localhost:3000"

3. Run the backend of the app
    - open another terminal and and cd into the backend directory
    - go to the CS97-App directory and run `cd backend`
    - run the command `npm start`

Now any objects inputted in the frontend will be sent to the backend database.
